# Kaggle Competitions

This repo contains the code for some of the [Kaggle Competitions](http://www.kaggle.com) I have tried out. I like to use either Python or Scala for these competitions and most of my code is written in [Jupyter Notebooks](http://www.jupyter.org).

## Competition Statuses
- *[AllState Claims Severity](./AllState)*: 
	- *Type*: Regression to predict loss based on claim data (no named features)
	- *Status*: Tried out several different boosting/ensembling methods w/ about a dozen submissions
- *[Transfer Learning on Stack Exchange Tags](./StackEchange)*:
	- *Type*: Text tagging with cross domain training (transfer learning)
	- *Status*: Implemented simple keyword based model, working on more advanced extraction
- *[Santander Product Pairing](./Santander)*:
	- *Type*: Classification? (TBD)
	- *Status*: Just started, doing exploratory analysis
